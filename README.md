# design-teardown
This project breaks apart the website for a popular  design magazine "Smashing Magazine". We attempted to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.This is also an opportunity to get better at positioning "div" elements without worrying too much about whatâ€™s inside them.The original website  can be found here
[http://smashingmagazine.com/](tp://smashingmagazine.com/)
